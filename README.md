# Portfolios:
## Data Analytic:
### - Data Analysis on Liga 1 Indonesia 2023-2024 Players

Using Python data visualization libraries (Pandas and Seaborn) to analyze a dataset of Liga 1 Indonesian Soccer Player 2023-2024. The data of the players include `player_name`, `market_value`, `nationality`, `birth_date`, `position`, `date_joined`, `contract`, and `club_name`. The aim of this analysis is to find players with the highest market value, compare the market value of local and foreign players, see the distribution of foreign players within the club, and find the youngest players and veteran players in the league.

## Data Science:
### - Sentiment Analysis on Mobile Legends Bang Bang Mobile Game Review (NLP and Classification Machine Learning)
Sentiment analysis on MLBB's recent 10.000 reviews on the Google Play Store then using Machine Learning to create the model to predict the sentiment of a review. The sentiment is divided into three categories: positive, neutral, and negative. The machine learning models used are Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting.

### - Predicting Saudi Used Car Prices using Machine Learning (Regression Machine Learning)

Sellers and buyers of used cars who do not have sufficient knowledge about cars will find it difficult to determine the price of the car to be sold. This can lead to unsold cars or losses for the seller, for the buyer the loss is the difficulty of deciding to buy a used car. This project is to create a model to predict the price of a used car based on the specifications of the car. The price generated by this model will be a reference for car sellers and buyers when buying and selling used cars. The goal is for used car sellers/buyers to make quicker decisions in conducting transactions (selling/buying).

### - Machine Learning Model for Predicting Property Value in Philadelphia (Regression Machine Learning Model)

Create a model to determine property value in the City of Philadelphia based on property characteristics created by the Philadelphia Office of Property Assessment (OPA). The goal is to obtain the true value of a property which will be used as the basis for determining the property tax price.
